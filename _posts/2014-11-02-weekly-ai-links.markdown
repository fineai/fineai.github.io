FineAI.com will be sharing about 4 gold quality links each week. This is our first installment in series of posts to come each week.

1. [**Video: Building the AI for Hearthstone via Gamasutra.com**](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/224101/Video_Building_the_AI_for_Hearthstone.php)

	Nice talk from [GDC 2014](http://www.gdcvault.com/browse/gdc-14). The interesting bit of the talk is from 12:00 to 22:00 mins of video. Rest of the talk is structured around the actual game development bit of it. We've all heard about Percept based agent from Peter Norvig's book. This is the first time I've seen it in action in real world. Given that AI systems get pretty low CPU budget some tricks were used: E.g. Caching & Delegating rule validations to UI that to AI. Its interesting to see how clever AI can be implemented under constraints. Doing a little bit more research We found an interesting talk at [I am a legend: Hacking Hearthstone with machine learning Defcon talk wrap-up via DEFCON](http://www.elie.net/blog/hearthstone/i-am-a-legend-hacking-hearthstone-with-machine-learning-defcon-talk-wrap-up#.VFXGOlOUe29) .

2. [**The Three Breakthroughs That Have Finally Unleashed AI on the World via Wired.com**](http://www.wired.com/2014/10/future-of-artificial-intelligence)

	Nice summary article, basically Cheap Parallel Processing, Big Data and Better Algorithms are at forefront of making AI finally happen. 

3. [**Why the Chess Computer Deep Blue Played Like a Human via Nautil.us**](http://nautil.us/issue/18/genius/why-the-chess-computer-deep-blue-played-like-a-human)
	
	Humans are known for having visual thinking and identifying perceptual patterns. This article connects dots between IBM Deep Blue's Bug to Randomness and Creativity. It touches upon learning by analogy as being a powerful tool for AI which humans are pretty good at. Markov Chains and its application for developing AI for Go have also been touched briefly upon. 

4. [**The AI Programmer's Bookshelf via Jeff Orkin**](http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~jorkin/aibooks.html)
	
	This is a nice meta-list of all books an AI programmers should have on their shelf. Covers classic works to Machine Learning, Game AI & NLP Books.
